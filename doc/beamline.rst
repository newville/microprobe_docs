General X-ray Microprobe Beamline Capabilities
=====================================================

The X-ray microprobe at GSECARS uses an undulator beamline to provides
fluxes in the range of :math:`10^{10}` to :math:`10^{12}` Hz in a a few
square microns, over an energy range of 2.4 to 27 keV.  This beam can be
used for X-ray Fluorescence maps, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray
diffraction.


Spot Size
==============

The typical X-ray spot size is :math:`1 \times 2` :math:`\rm{\mu}m` using
Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors which separately focus in the horizontal and
vertical directions.  The vertical beam is much easier to achieve a fine
focus and no additional optics are needed.  For the horizontal direction,
the beamline mirrors that are used to deflect the beam away from the
in-board branch line are also used to focus the beam onto an aperture, at
roughly 42 m from the undulator source.  By closing this *secondary source
aperture*, the re-diverging beam can be focused with the final mirror of
the KB pair.  By adjusting this secondary aperture, one can trade final
spot size for intensity.  The beamline normally operates with a slit that
passes about 20% of the full flux into about 2 :math:`\rm{\mu}m`.

Since X-rays penetrate deeply into most materials, typical sampling
:math:`1/e` depths range from 5 to 250 :math:`\rm{\mu}m`, with 50
:math:`\rm{\mu}m` being a good rule of thumb.



Energy Range
==============

The energy range for the GSECARS beamline is 2.4 to 27 keV.  The
monochromator has very reliable energy reading, and XAFS scans are easy.
Changing energy between elements is very easy between about 4 and 22 keV
and can be done from pre-defined scripts that not only move the
monochromator angle, but also undulator harmonics and mirror coatings.

Working below 4 keV or above 22 keV is not hard, but sometimes requires
special care.


Positional Stability
======================

The monochromator deflects the beam vertically.
