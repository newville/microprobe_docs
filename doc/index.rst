The GSECARS X-ray Microprobe Beamline, APS 13-ID-E
========================================================

Data Collection at the GSECARS X-ray Microprobe at APS beamline 13-ID-E
centers on collecting X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectra and maps with
micron-scale resolution.  Important capabilities also include doing X-ray
Absorption Fine-Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
at the micron scale.  This document describes the software used for
operating the X-ray Microprobe.
