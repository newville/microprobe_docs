Data Collection at 13-ID-E Microprobe
==========================================================================

Data Collection at the GSECARS X-ray Microprobe centers on collecting X-ray
Fluorescence (XRF) spectra and maps with micron-scale resolution.
Important capabilities also include doing X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure
Spectroscopy (XAFS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) at the micron scale.  This
document describes the software used for operating the X-ray Microprobe.
