The GSECARS X-ray Microprobe Beamline, APS 13-ID-E
========================================================

Data Collection at the GSECARS X-ray Microprobe, APS beamline 13-ID-E,
centers on collecting X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Maps with micron-scale
resolution and X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS)
data.  X-ray Diffraction (XRD) at the micron scale is also supported.

This document describes the beamline capabilities and the software used
for operating the X-ray Microprobe.
