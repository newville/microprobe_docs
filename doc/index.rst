The GSECARS X-ray Microprobe Beamline, APS 13-ID-E
========================================================

Data Collection at the GSECARS X-ray Microprobe at APS beamline 13-ID-E centers
on collecting X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Maps with micron-scale resolution and
X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS) data.  X-ray Diffraction
(XRD) at the micron scale is also supported.  This document describes the
software used for operating the X-ray Microprobe.
