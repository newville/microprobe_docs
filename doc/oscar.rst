Using the SampleStage Control and Off-line Microscope
=======================================================


For most microprobe users, moving your sample into the beam, finding and
saving places to analyze, and capturing the video images are all important
parts of the data collection process. As mentioned in :ref:`Getting Started
at the Beamline <starting-chapter>`, the Sample Stage window is the main
interface for all of these controls.

The main Sample Control Window shows a live image of your sample, as well
as controls for moving the motorize stages to position the sample in the
beam.  Typically, the field of view for this microscope is 1 mm (a 100
micron scalebar in shown in the lower right of the image).  In addition,
there are two other video cameras at the beamline to see roughly 30 mm and
1 m fields of view around the Sample-Beam position to help you position the
sample in the X-ray beam.

From the Sample Stage Window you can move the sample stage motors using
arrows, dropdown menus, or typing in absolute values for the position of
each of the sample stages used (there are five or six of these, depending
on your experiment). You can also adjust the video controls (shutter time,
gain, color balance, and so on).  Finally, you can als save positions by
giving them a name.  Simply typing a name and hitting return will save the
current position, and add it to the list of Saved Positions in the right
hand side.  You can select any of these, and then hit **Go To** to move
that Saved Position.  Saving a position also captures the image so that you
can view it later, including from a simple HTML file `SampleStage.html` in
the main data directory.
